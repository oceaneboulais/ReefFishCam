WELCOME TO THE CODE FOR KILOCAM V3

NOTE: This code should only be used with KiloCam V3 boards and ESP32-CAM boards that are also running the code for KiloCam V3 serial comms.
Don't know your board version? Check the PCB for a version number. Most KiloCam V2 and older boards are green. KiloCam V3 is blue. 

A huge thank you to KiloCam user Mark Pinches to helping develop serial communications used in this version of KiloCam. 

This updated code enables users to do a couple things (new and old)...
- Automatic timestamping of images and improved efficiency through serial communications between the KiloCam and ESP32-CAM PCBs
- Set a specific start time and date for the camera to first boot up after deployment.
KiloCam will remain inactive and in a low-power sleep state until this start time/date occurs. 
- Set a sampling frequency (in seconds) of how often to collect data AFTER the start time/date has occurred.  
- Define two activity states a day time activity state with a specific sampling frequency, and a dark state activity with a specific frequency
- Define a range of hours, for example 09:00 (represented as "9") to 14:00 (represented as "14"), that represent
the times at which behvaiour changes between the two states. 
This is helpful if, for example, you want videos to flash the LED at night but not during the day.

Instructions to program your KiloCam: 
1. Search for "STEP 1:", go to the following line: "RTC.setAlarm(ALM1_MATCH_HOURS, 15, 45, 20, 0);"

  Adjust the time/date above as needed. Above, 45 represents minutes, 20 represents hours, 
  and 15 represents seconds. So KiloCam will initiate its capture interval from the next time it encounters 
  20:45:15 (8:45:15 PM) after programming. If the sampling interval is set to 3600 (one hour in seconds), then the second 
  data capture will occur at 21:45:15 or (9:45:15 PM).

  Alternatively, replace the line with "RTC.setAlarm(ALM1_MATCH_DATE, 48, 14, 10);", which would allow you to set KiloCam to activate on
  the tenth day of the month, at 14 hours and 48 minutes. So if KiloCam is programmed on September 1st, it will not
  activate until September 10th at 14:48 (2:48 PM). This is useful if you want to deploy cameras well before data capture. 
  Note that the low-power sleep state of KiloCam is approximately 0.14 mA prior to the first activation and between scheduled data captures.

2. Search for "STEP 2:", go to the following line: "unsigned long alarmInterval = 3600;"

  Adjust the value to whatever sampling interval, in seconds, you want between KiloCam data collections during the day period.
  For example, one hour is 3600 seconds, six hours is 21600 seconds, twelve hours is 43200 seconds, twenty-four hours is 86400 seconds.
  When writing your value, do not include any commas for values in the thousands etc. 
  Repeated sampling by KiloCam will occur at this interval AFTER the initial alarm time (Step 1). So, if 
  the initial alarm is set for September 3 at 14:00, and we have an interval of 180 seconds (3 minutes), then
  KiloCam will collect data at 14:00, 14:03, 14:06, 14:09, 15:02, etc until it runs out of camera battery. 

  NOTE: The shortest reccomended capture frequency is 10 seconds. Current while capturing an image is approximately 50 mA but 
  may spike as high as 300 mA.  

  Adjust the "unsigned long darkAlarmInterval = 3600" to the desired sampling frequency during the dark period, as above. 

3. Search for "unsigned int Dawn =" or "unsigned int Dusk ="

  Adjust these values to represent the earliest and latest hours of the day (respectively) that you want 
  KiloCam to capture data. Setting Dawn = 0 and Dusk = 23 with a 3600 second sampling interval (1 hour) will 
  enable KiloCam to capture data every hour, 24 hours a day. Setting Dawn = 8 and Dusk = 18
  with a 7200 sampling interval will enable KiloCam to capture data every 2 hours from 08:00 to 18:00 each day.

  These times will reflect the time at which kilocams behaviour changes. If you want the original behaviour please 
  comment out the lines in the else statement below 

4. BEFORE UPLOADING! 
  In the Arduino IDE under "Tools" set the Board to "Arduino Pro or Pro Mini", set the Processor to "ATMEGA328P 3.3V 8MHz). 
  Plug in your USB FTDI programmer, and select the appropriate serial port under "Tools" in the Arduino IDE. 
  Set your FTDI programmer to 3.3V by adjusting the jumper, located near the pins on most FTDI boards. 
  Attach your FTDI programmer to the KiloCam PCB so that the GND and DTR pins on the programmer align with those marked on the PCB. 
  Hold the FTDI programmer gently in place to maintain a good connection, then hit "Upload" in the Arduino IDE. 
  Wait until the Arduino IDE reports "Done Uploading" before you disconnect the FTDI programmer from the KiloCam PCB.  
  
NOTES: 
- Before attaching your ESP32-CAM to the KiloCam PCB, make sure you have uploaded the appropriate ESP32-CAM code to your ESP32-CAM board.
- When programming KiloCam you should have a serial monitor open and set to 57600 baud. KiloCam will 
report back the current time, make sure this is correct before deploying. If it is not, use the "SetTime" or "SetTime_serial" 
examples from the Arduino RTCLib library to reprogram your PCB's real-time clock. Sketches from DS3232RTC.h work as well.      
- Power consumption of the KiloCam PCB is low, about 0.14 mA when sleeping and 5 mA when active, and 50 mA when capturing a photo. 
Be mindful of how long you can have KiloCam deployed based on your chosen power source and capture schedule(see above).
- Please make sure you have the DS3232RTC.h, Time.h, and LowPower.h libraries installed before attempting to load this
code onto your KiloCam. If you do not have these installed from the github directories linked below, the code will fail. 
- For more information on how to get more creative with your initial KiloCam activation time or repeated 
sampling invervals, check out the DS3232RTC library repository on Github at the links below.
